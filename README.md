# Cocktail Mixer

## Purpose

This project is to help study for the [Columbia Bartending Agency](https://columbiabartending.com/)'s  bartending exam. It is a web application that allows users to create and mix cocktails for certain recipes, and then check if their mix is correct. As of now, it is a very basic tool, I am planning on improving animations and adding more features.

## Packages & Installation

This project is built with Node.js and uses `npm` to manage packages. To get started, you'll need to have Node.js installed on your machine.

It is highly recommended to use [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) (Node Version Manager) to ensure you are using the correct Node.js version for this project.

1.  **nvm:** Install `nvm` by following the instructions in its repository. Once installed, you can run the following commands in the project's root directory:

    ```bash
    nvm install
    nvm use
    ```

    This will automatically install and switch to the Node.js version specified in the `.nvmrc` file.

2.  **Node.js:** If you are not using `nvm`, you can download and install the version specified in the `.nvmrc` file from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).
3.  **npm:** This is included with the Node.js installation.

## Local Development

To run the application on your local machine, follow these steps:

    npm install
    ```

4.  **Run the development server:**
